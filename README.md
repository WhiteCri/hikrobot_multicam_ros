# hikrobot multicam ros
---
Strongly inspired by [repo](https://github.com/luckyluckydadada/HIKROBOT-MVS-CAMERA-ROS), this repository optimized cpu usage and supports multiple cam in a same device.

In my case using 2448 * 2048 mono8 resolution frame, 70% of CPU usage decreased.

This driver is thread-safe.
